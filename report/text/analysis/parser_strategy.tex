\section{Parser Strategy}
\label{Parserstrategy}
There are two ways of parsing an abstract syntax tree, which is seen below:

\subsection*{Top Down}
Top down derives the parse tree from the left. This means that a non-terminal cannot have two derivations with the same start terminal or nonterminal, e.g. A -> BC | BD. This way the parser does not know which derivation to take, because both of them start with the same nonterminal.
This can be avoided by using a bottom up method.

\subsection*{Bottom Up}
Bottom up derives the parse tree from the right, which makes the expression: A -> BC | BD legal for a bottom up parser, because it looks at C and D first and then decides which derivation to pick.

\subsection*{Conclusion}
A top down (LL) derivation of the parser will be used in this language, because that is what the group learned first, because a useful program was introduced in a course, which could check if the parser is LL. This is beneficial in making the parser LL.
