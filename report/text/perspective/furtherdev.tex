The developed slideshow programming language and compiler can be improved. The improvements are specified in a priority list, meaning that the those listed first should be granted the highest priority.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item More describing error messages have to be made, in the lexer, parser and the semantic analyser, to make errors more understandable for the user.
	\item The language has to be systematically, and thoroughly, tested, to make sure that no exceptions are not caught by the compiler.
	\item The lexer should be able to support all the font families that CSS does, so that the user would be able to use every font family he would like to use.
	\item It should be possible to make regions of slides, meaning that a user defined number of slides is in a region name or number. This region name, or number, can be used when changing settings, to target that region only.
	\item Add the functionality behind giving slides names.
	\item It would be nice to have a more programmer minded language. It could have a ``main'' function, which calls the slides. Giving the opportunity to name slides, and an easier way to switch the order of slides, gives the opportunity to call the same slide more than once.
	\item Speakers' notes should also be implemented at some point, to make it more applicable in presentation situations, e.g. meetings.
	\item The compiler should be able to complete the lexer even with errors, and if there are errors, then terminate when the lexer has finished, finally calling all of the errors. The same goes for the parser.
	\item Another feature that could be implemented is the ability to change the background colour on the slides, or even insert an image as background.
	\item Since slides have unique names, a reference function could be made, which writes the slide number of a specific slide name in a slide.
