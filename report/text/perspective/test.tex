\chapter{Test}
In the beginning of this project, the group members had some requirement for the new language.  One of those was that the language should be faster to make slideshows than other already existing languages. To see how our language fulfill this requirement, the group decided to make a test, to see how long it would take to make slideshows in our language and in other languages and programs.\\

Today the most popular languages and programs are Microsoft PowerPoint, Latex Beamer and Keynode. During the test, we perform the same slideshow on all programs and languages. The following table shows the result of the test.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}
    \hline
    Program / language & Time in minute \\ \hline
    Microsoft PowerPoint & 5.55 	Min \\ \hline
    Keynode & 12.40 				Min \\ \hline
    Latex Beamer & 45 				Min \\ \hline
    NISSE & 9.45 					Min \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The result shows that NISSE is much faster than Latex Beamer and Keynode.  Testing Beamer took too much time, because we need some package that should be installed before we could use a specific function on Beamer.

During the test of our language, we discovered some problem that we never before had discovered, we had problem with the character ?dash? and ?tab?, which make it difficult to compile the slideshow.
