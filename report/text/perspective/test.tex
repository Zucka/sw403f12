\chapter{Test}
In the beginning of this project, the group members made some requirements for the slideshow programming language. One of these was that the program should be faster to create slideshows in, than already existing slideshow programming languages. \\
To see whether the developed language was able to fulfil this requirement, the group decided to make a test, to see how long it would take to create slideshows in the language, and compared it to other languages and programs for creating slideshows
\\ \\
The most popular slideshow programming languages and -programs today, are; Microsoft PowerPoint, \LaTeX~Beamer and Apple Keynote. \\
During the test, the test slideshow is created using the slideshow programming software mentioned above. \\
The following table shows the result of the test:

\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}
    \hline
    Program / language & Time \\ \hline
    Apple Keynote & 12 minutes 40 seconds \\ \hline
    \LaTeX~Beamer & $\sim$ 45 minutes \\ \hline
    Microsoft PowerPoint & 05 minutes 55 seconds \\ \hline
    NISSE & 09 minutes 45 seconds \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent{The table shows that NISSE is much faster than \LaTeX~Beamer and Apple Keynote, though, it is still close to be twice the time to create a slideshow using Nisse compared to Microsoft PowerPoint. \\
The testing of \LaTeX~Beamer took too much time, because additional packages had to be installed at the test computer, to create the test slideshow.}

During the test of the developed slideshow programming language, the group encountered an otherwise undiscovered problem. The problem was with the characters ``dash'' and ``tab'', which make it difficult to compile the slideshow.
