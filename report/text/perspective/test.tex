\chapter{Test}
In the beginning of this project, we made some requirements for the slideshow programming language. One of these was that the program should be faster to create slideshows in, than already existing slideshow programming languages. \\
To see whether the developed language was able to fulfil this requirement, we made a test, to see how long it would take to create slideshows in our language, and compared it to other languages and programs for creating slideshows.
\\ \\
Earlier in the report a few other slideshow programs was mentioned; Microsoft PowerPoint, \LaTeX~Beamer and Apple Keynote. These programs will be compared to the developed language.\\
The test consists of five slides. The slides were the same on each of the tests, to make the complexity equal. The test person was one of the group members, which has experience in the developed language, and also the rest of the programs, for that matter.
The result of the test is shown in table \ref{tbl:TestTable}.
\begin{table}
\centering
   \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}
    \hline
    Program / language & Time \\ \hline
    NISSE (PC) & 09 minutes 45 seconds \\ 
    \LaTeX~Beamer (PC) & $\sim$ 45 minutes \\
    Microsoft PowerPoint (PC) & 05 minutes 55 seconds \\ 
    Apple Keynote (Ipad) & 12 minutes 40 seconds \\ 
    NISSE (Ipad) & 09 minutes 00 seconds \\ \hline
    
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Test table}
    \label{tbl:TestTable}
\end{table}
The tests were made in the same order they occurred in the table.\\

During the test of the developed slideshow programming language on the computer, we encountered an otherwise undiscovered problem. The problem was with the characters ``dash'' and ``tab'', these characters are now added to the language. Otherwise the syntax was correct for NISSE.\\
The testing of \LaTeX~Beamer took a lot of time, because additional packages had to be installed on the test computer, and specific commands had to be found on the Internet in order to create the test slideshow.
The Microsoft PowerPoint presentation was the absolutely fastest way to create the test slideshow, but this test was mainly made to compare pointing languages with non-pointing language. This showed a huge amount of saved time compared to the rest. \\
The main result of this test is that developing the test slideshow on an Ipad with Apple Keynote and NISSE, showed that NISSE takes less time to create a slideshow in. NISSE also beats \LaTeX~Beamer considering the user has to browse the internet for certain commands and packages.
\\ \\
The reason that it was faster to create the test slideshow with Ipad than on PC might have been that the test person knew what was on the slides, after creating the same slideshow four times.
