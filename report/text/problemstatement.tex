\section{Initiating Problem}
It is hard to use a pointing device to create slideshows while using a mobile device \footnote{A mobile device is defined as a laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.}. To this extent, a more mobile slideshow language will be created, which would be a great way to create slideshows while ´´on the go’’. \\
How can a language remove the need for a pointing device \footnote{A pointing device is defined as a mouse, trackball, touchpad or pointing stick} when creating slideshows?
