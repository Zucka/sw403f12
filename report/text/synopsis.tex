In this project, a programming language for creating slideshows has been developed. \\
Furthermore a compiler for the language has been developed, which makes it possible to compile the written code into an HTML-file. The development of the language is described throughout the report. \\
The main focus of the project was to make a programming language that could make it possible to create slideshows without using a pointing device. \\
Another requirement for the language was that the language should be faster to creating slideshows in than already existing languages, such as \LaTeX~Beamer.
\\ \\
The developed slideshow programming language fulfils the major language requirements described in the ``requirements'' section \ref{LanguageRequirements}.
