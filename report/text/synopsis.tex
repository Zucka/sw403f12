%In this project, we have been developing a programming language for slideshows. Furthermore we have developed the compiler for the language, which make it possible to compile the written code to html. The main focus of the project was to make a programming language that could make it possible to make slideshows without using a pointing device, another requirement for the language was that the language should be faster to make slideshows on than already existing language such as Latex Beamer.

In this project, a programming language for creating slideshows has been developed. \\
Furthermore a compiler for the language has been developed, which makes it possible to compile the written code into an HTML-file. The development of the language is described throughout the report. \\
The main focus of the project was to make a programming language that could make it possible to create slideshows without using a pointing device. \\
Another requirement for the language was that the language should be faster to creating slideshows in than already existing languages, such as \LaTeX~Beamer.

The developed slideshow programming language fulfils the major requirements described in the system requirements.
