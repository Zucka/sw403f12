In this project, we have been developing a programming language for slideshows. Furthermore we have developed the compiler for the language, which make it possible to compile the written code to html. The main focus of the project was to make a programming language that could make it possible to make slideshows without using a pointing device, another requirement for the language was that the language should be faster to make slideshows on than already existing language such as Latex Beamer.
