\label{ProblemFormulation}
How can you make a better alternative to \LaTeX~Beamer? \\
How can you create a programming language in which a user can make a slideshow presentation without the need for a pointing device, and not have to think about the layout of single slides, but only define the general layout? \\
Furthermore, how can you display the presentation in a way, such that it will look the same on all devices, while still being usable on these devices? \\
How can you make a suitable domain specific language with weight on consistency and simplicity, while enabling the user to focus on the content rather than the layout?
\\ \\
The following questions provide a limitation for the scope of the project:
\\ \\
Which platform should be used for presentation? \\
Which layout decisions does the user need? \\
What are the language limitations? \\
What can be expressed in the language?
