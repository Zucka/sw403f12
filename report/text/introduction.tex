\chapter{Introduction}
Nearly Instantaneous Slide Show Expressions, also known as NISSE, is the name of the programming language being developed.

\textbf{SOMETHING SOMETHING more general introduction to the report}

\section{Server Compiler}
A way to make the language easier to compile is to take the workload off the user's computer, and place it on a server. This creates the aspect that you can write and compile code anywhere, on any computer, or mobile device\footnote{A mobile device is defined as a laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.}, with internet access without any additional programs.
Having the compilation phase on a server creates the possibility to write the slideshow\footnote{The slideshow is being compiled in to one single HTML-file} on a cellphone, which can send the code to the server and receive the presentation on the device.
With the Internet getting faster and faster\textbf{KILDE!}, more users are online, which does not limit the possibility for the users to compile their slideshows, although the compiler can be downloaded for offline use if needed.
